The game begins in a buy phase where both players will buy weapons and defenses.

After both player are done buying, the battle phase begins.

Each player can take one action per turn: attack or defend.

If the player chooses to attack, player will be asked to choose the target city. Each city is displayed on the map with its corresponding number.

If the player choose to defend, player will be provided with the list of weapons currently launched, and player can neutralise that weapon immediately.

Player loses if:
1. All the cities are destroyed
2. No weapons or defenses are left

Although the basic functionality of the game is complete, I believe that the game is very raw and needs to be polished more.
Given the time constraint, I couldn't fully implement all the features that I had originally intended to.
